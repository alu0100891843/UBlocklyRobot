# UBlocklyRobot
***This tool development in Unity allows designing and customizing a robot adding sensors to the body. After its creation, it can be tested in a simulation environment with different challenges. In this environment, we will define the behaviour of the robot by means of a block based visual programming language, in which we will be able to gather the instructions and the information gathered by the sensors that we have added to our design to overcome the challenges proposed.***
